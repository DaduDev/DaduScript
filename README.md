# DaduScript

This is a programming language that I've created by myself using the basic tree concepts in Python.


## Operations

We can perform basic arithmetic, Logical and Comparision operations directly here:

addition:
```DaduScript
>>> 1 + 2
3
```
substraction:
```DaduScript
>>> 1 + 2
3
```
multiplication:
```DaduScript
>>> 1 * 2
2
```
division:
```DaduScript
>>> 1 / 2 #division
0.5
```
modulos:
```DaduScript
>>> 1 % 2
1
```
and operation:
```DaduScript
>>> 1 and 2
1
```
or operation:
```DaduScript
>>> 1 or 2
1
```
not operation:
```DaduScript
>>> not 1
0
```
greater than operation:
```DaduScript
>>> 1 > 2
0
```
less than operation:
```DaduScript
>>> 1 < 2
1
```
equals operation:
```DaduScript
>>> 1 == 2
0
```
not equals operation:
```DaduScript
>>> 1 != 2
1
```
greater than or equals operation:
```DaduScript
>>> 1 >= 2
0
```
less than or equals operation:
```DaduScript
>>> 1 <=> 2
1
```
